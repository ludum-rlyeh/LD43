# Armorican Defenders

Akim, the blacksmith's son, has come to get you. 
Enemies are at your doorsteps. 
As tribal chief, you must take in charge the management of your defences.

However, the druids warn you, your enemies are not human and 
if you want the gods to help you, **sacrifices must be made**.
